# automate_with_python

This repo contains automation codes for different problems faced in daily tech usage.
These are just preliminary codes made during my summer holidays.
If anyone wants to improve the codes, he/she is welcomed to fork the repo and send a PR.

*Some codes may not work on all pcs.*
